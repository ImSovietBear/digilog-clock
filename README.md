# digilog-clock
An arduino clock that uses LED's instead of hands on an analog clock. 

This isn't even closed to finished and I don't even have the parts, I've been testing them on spare LED's and my arduino Uno.
This project will later be made on an arduino pro micro from sparkfun.
extremely crude mock up of finished product made in MS paint(techincally PSE 14): http://i.imgur.com/FestIS3.jpg
Both LED rings and the LED matrix are under the paper. This will probably look 10x better than that drawing.

Things todo:
-add compatability with this: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3150 screen, it will be placed in the middle.
-add compatability with this: https://www.amazon.com/CTYRZCH-Infrared-Control-Receiver-Raspberry/dp/B015SMS5L0/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1492020871&sr=1-1&keywords=arduino+remote remote for user control.
-add compatability with this: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3013 RTC, will be used for keeping track of time.
-add dial for controlling brightness (variable and function is already there).
